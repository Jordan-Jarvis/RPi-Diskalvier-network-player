This distribution contains a tool which permit you to get
the metadata information included in a standard MIDI file.

The following files are included in the distribution:

    C Source Code 
        main.c            Main source code file
        tmidi.c           Source code with information extractor
        tmidi.h           Definitions for tmidi.c
        extractorXML.c    File that creates a XML chain
        extractorXML.h    Definitions for extractorXML.c
        define.h          Global constants

    Build Utilities
        Makefile          Compiles the project
        
    Documentation
        README            This file

    Specifications
        metamidi.dtd      DTD file
	metamidi.xsd	  XMLSchema for automatic parser generation
	metamidi-java.jar Parser generated with XMLBeans

	

Usage: metamidi -{r|x|l} file [-o fileoutput]
-r file : shows metadata in register format. 
        The information are distributed in general metadata and track metadata.

-l file : shows metadata in line format. 
        A "|" character is used to separate the general metadata from track 
        metadata and the same character is used too to separete the different 
        track metadata. 
        A ";" character is used to separate each feature. 
        The order of each feature is the same in the register format.
        "," character separates multi-valuated features.
        "$" charactes codes empty (not present) features.

-x file : shows metadata in xml format. 
        File metamidi.dtd is a DTD where tags and attributes are described.

Option: 
-o fileoutput : sends output to a file

Description of each general metadata:
        name:             name of file.
        metaeventtext:    text information.
        size:             size in bytes.

        num traks:        number of file tracks.
        resolution:       number of clock ticks (pulses) per beat.
        tempo:            number of beats per minute.
        tempo changes:    number of tempo change messages.
        meter:            list of number of beats per bar over beat kind. The pulse where it changes is showed between brackets.
        meter changes:    number of meter changes.
        key:              tonality. The pulse where it changes is showed between brackets.
        key changes:      number of tonality changes.
        instruments:      used patch numbers.
        percussion:       Number of percussion group. 1 for drums, 2 for latin and 3 for others.
        duration:         number of clock ticks until the offset of the last note.
        has sysex:        1 if yes, 0 if no sysex message appears.

Description of each track metadata:
        metaeventtext:           text informations included in the track.
        duration:                number of ticks in the track from the onset of 
                                 its first note to the offset of its last note.
        duration rate:           = track duration / song duration.
        occupation:              number of ticks where notes are sounding.
        occupation rate:         = track occupation / track duration.
        polyphony duration rate: = ticks where two or more notes are sounding / track duration.
        max polyphony:           number of maximum simultaneous notes.
        avg polyphony:           number of sounding notes in average (weighted by their durations).
        low pitch:               lowest note pitch.
        high pitch:              highest note pitch.
        modulations:             number of modulation messages.
